## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox


### What I learned

Had to learn z-indexing, in order to superpose the main divs together

```css
.right{
  z-index: 1;
}
.left{
  z-index: -1;
}
```

### Continued development

Still working on the responsiveness for this compinent. So as to make it fit on mobile devices too.

### Useful resources

- [Example resource 1](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/z-index) - This helped me for  z-indexing. Really summarised and great examples that make you understand the concept.
